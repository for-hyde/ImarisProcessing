# R Shiny Imaris Data Processing Application
This application is currently being created as part of an internship with the Duarte Campos group. The primary purpose is to enable simplified data processing of data generated by Imaris imaging software. 

## Features
- Efficient processing of features extracted from images in Imaris. 
- Selection of condition parameters based on file naming conventions.
- Selection of well and count information.
- Generation of PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP for dimensionality reduction. 
- Export of the resulting dataframe as a csv file. 

This repository is still a work in progress and more functions are set to be added.
